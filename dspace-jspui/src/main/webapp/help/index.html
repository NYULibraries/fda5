 <p> The Faculty Digital Archive (FDA) is powered by DSpace, a software that captures, distributes and preserves digital research products. 
    Here you can find articles, working papers, preprints, technical reports, conference papers 
    and data sets in various digital formats. Content grows daily as new communities 
    and collections are added to the FDA.</p>
<p>The FDA content is organized 
  around Communities which can correspond to administrative entities such as schools, 
  departments, labs and research centers. Within each community there can be an 
  unlimited number subcommunities and an unlimited number of collections. Each collection 
    may contain an unlimited number of items.

<p><strong>Browse</strong> allows you to go through a list of items in some specified order:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Browse by Communities and Collections </strong> takes you through the communities in alphabetical 
order and allows you to see the subcommunities and collections within each community. NYU schools and colleges are represented by top-level Communities, in which faculty work is organized into Collections.</p>
<p><strong>Browse by Issue Date </strong>allows you to move through a list of all items in the FDA in reverse chronological order (most recent first).</p>
<p><strong>Browse by Author</strong> allows you to move through an alphabetical list of all authors of items in the FDA.</p>
<p><strong>Browse by Title</strong> allows you to move through an alphabetical list of all titles of items in the FDA.</p>
<p><strong>Browse by Subject </strong>allows you to move through an alphabetical list of subjects assigned to items in the FDA.</p>

  <li>subscribe to a collection and receive e-mail updates when new items are added</li>
  <li>add new content</li>
  <li>edit your profile</li>
  <li>view restricted collections (e.g. some school’s theses and dissertations are only available to active members of the NYU community)</li>

<p>When you access an area 
  of the FDA that requires authorization, the system will require you to log in with your NYU netID and password.
  All users can register to become subscribers to public collections. Some restricted functions, such 
  as content submission, require authorization from the community.</p>


<p><strong>My FDA</strong> is a personal 
  page that is maintained for each member. This page can contain a list of items 
  that are in the submission process for a particular member, or a task list of 
  items that need attention such as editing, reviewing, or checking.</p>
<p><strong>Edit Profile</strong> allows

<p>To search all of the FDA, use the the Search option on the top right corner or the search box in the middle of the home page. </p>
<p> To limit your search to 
  a specific community or collection, navigate to that community or collection 
  and use the search bar on that page.</p>

<p>The FDA uses the<strong> Solr/Lucene</strong> search engine. Here are some search hints:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The word(s) you enter in the search box will be searched against each item’s descriptive metadata (including title, author, subject, series, etc.). Additionally, the word(s) you enter will also be searched across the full text of the item itself, if the item has been optimized for optical character recognition (OCR).</p>
  <p><strong>What is not searched 
    - Stop Words<br />
    </strong>The<strong> </strong>search engine ignores certain words that occur frequently in 
    English, but do not add value to the search. These are: </p>
  <p align="center"> "a", "and" 
    , "are" , "as" , "at" , "be" , "but" , "by" , "for" , "if" , "in" , "into", 
    </p>
  <p align="center">"is" ,"it" 
    ,"no" , "not" , "of" , "on" , "or" , "such", "the" , "to" , "was"</p>
  
  <p><strong>Truncation<br />
    </strong>Use an asterisk (*) after a word stem to get all hits having words starting 
    with that root, for example: </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> For example:
      Select* will retrieve selects, selector, selectman, selecting. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Stemming <br />
    </strong>The search engine automatically expands words with common endings to include plurals, past tenses, etc.</p>
  <p><strong>Phrase Searching</strong><br />
    To search using multiple words as a phrase, put quotation marks (&quot;) around 
    the phrase.</p>
  For example: "organizational change"
  <p><strong>Exact word match</strong><br />
    Put a plus (+) sign before a word if it MUST appear in the search result. 
    For instance, in the following search the word &quot;training&quot; is optional, 
    but the word &quot;dog&quot; must be in the result. </p>
  <blockquote> 
   For example: <b>+dog training</b>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Eliminate items with 
    unwanted words<br />
    </strong>Put a minus (-) sign before a word if it should not appear in the search 
    results. Alternatively, you can use <strong>NOT</strong>. This can limit your search 
    to eliminate unwanted hits. 
  <blockquote> 
    For example: In the search<b>training -cat</b> or <b>training NOT cat</b> you will get items containing 
    the word &quot;training&quot;, except those that also contain the word &quot;cat&quot;.  </blockquote></p>
  <p><strong>Boolean searching</strong></p>
  <p>The following Boolean 
    operators can be used to combine terms. Note that they must be CAPITALIZED!</p>
	<ol>
  <li><p><strong>AND</strong> - to limit 
    searches to find items containing all words or phrases combined with this 
    operator, e.g.</p>
  <blockquote> 
 <b>cats AND dogs</b>
      will retrieve all items that contain BOTH the words &quot;cats&quot; and 
      &quot;dogs&quot;.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <li><p><strong>OR</strong> - to enlarge 
    searches to find items containing any of the words or phrases surrounding 
    this operator </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <b>cats OR dogs</b>
      will retrieve all items that contain EITHER the words &quot;cats&quot; or 
      &quot;dogs&quot;.</p>
  </blockquote>
  </ol>
  <p>Parentheses can be used 
    in the search query to group search terms into sets, and operators can then 
    be applied to the whole set.
	For example:</p>

  Some collections require the submission to go through editing or review steps,

<p> Collection administrators have the ability to add content to, modify existing content in, and remove content from their collections.</p> 

<p>Once you have submitted something to your collection, a FDA record is created for the uploaded file. That file and the descriptive information about it (the "metadata") are called an "item." An item in the FDA can have multiple digital files attached to it. 
For example, you may want to store a high-quality image file and a smaller, compressed derivative of it together as a single item.</p>

<p>To add a new file to an already-existing item in the FDA, browse to the item in your collection you want to add to and click on the 'Open' button. Once the home page of the item opens, select 'Edit' on the left.</p>
<p>The submission process starting with <strong>Step 1: License</strong> will begin and new files can be added to the item and current files can also be deleted.</p>
<p>You can also edit or add metadata to any item in your collection after the item has been uploaded. Navigate to the item to be edited and go to <strong>Step 3: Describe</strong> and change the fields of metadata that need to be edited. When finished, click the Update button to save your changes.</p>

<p>When your item becomes a 
  part of the FDA repository it is assigned a persistent URL. This means that, 
  unlike most URLs, this identifier will not have to be changed when the system 
  migrates to new hardware, or when changes are made to the system. The FDA
  is committed to maintaining the integrity of this identifier 
  so that you can safely use it to refer to your item when citing it in publications
