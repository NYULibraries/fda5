<h3>What is the Faculty Digital Archive (FDA)?</h3>
<p>The Faculty Digital Archive is a highly visible repository of NYU scholarship, allowing digital works—text, audio, video, data, and more—to be reliably shared and securely stored. Collections may be made freely available worldwide, offered to NYU only, or restricted to a specific group. <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/its/faculty/fda" class="readmore">more info</a></p>
<h3>Who can deposit material in the FDA?</h3>
<p>Full-time faculty may deposit their research—unpublished and, in many cases, published—in the FDA. Departments, centers, or institutes may also use the FDA to distribute working papers, technical reports, or other research material. <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/its/faculty/fda" class="readmore">more info</a></p>
<h3>Who can access the FDA?</h3>
<p>By default, content in the FDA is world-readable, unless collection owners choose to restrict access. <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/its/faculty/fda"class="readmore">more info</a></p>
<h3>Finding material</h3>
<p>You can browse or search the FDA using the Browse and Search links in the navigation menu to the top of every page. Collections and items in the FDA all have a URL that is a permanent link--it will always work, and can be used in citations. <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/its/faculty/fda" class="readmore">more info</a></p>
<h3>Restricted material</h3>
<p>While most of the collections in the FDA are open to anyone on the internet, some are restricted by their owners. If you have questions about restricted resources, please write to <a href="mailto:archive.help@nyu.edu">archive.help@nyu.edu</a>.</p>
